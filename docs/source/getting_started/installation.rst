Installation
==========================

The PyXAB package is still under development. We recommend to directly git clone the package and then install it at the moment.

We will release the package to PyPI and Conda when it is ready.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/WilliamLwj/PyXAB.git
   cd PyXAB
   pip install .
